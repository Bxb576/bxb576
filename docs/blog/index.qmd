A meaningful takeaway from Jeff Leek’s How to Be a Modern Scientist, in my opinion, was his breakdown of social media’s role in science. In today’s world, it’s essentially unfathomable that anyone would lack at least one form of social media presence. However, those of us who have either strayed away from it or try to maintain a healthy distance may struggle with this provision from Leek. As someone who tends to avoid most social media, the idea of cultivating an online persona for professional engagement in the future is a strange pill to swallow.

In his writing, Leek argues that forming a community online is the first step toward building a notable presence. The key strategies for doing so include posting relatable content for one’s intended audience and planting the seed for engaging forms of discourse. Now that many fellow researchers, scientific journals and news sources operate either entirely or heavily online, the space for networking has expanded into these virtual arenas as well.

Leek’s explanation of social media’s importance in science and research spheres has inspired me to begin reframing my outlook, at least through a professional lens. While I still may not be fully open to embracing the world of social media, How to Be a Modern Scientist has opened my eyes to the need for flexibility when it comes to the digital side of society in science. As a budding research scientist, now is as crucial a time as ever to engage with future audiences and peers in my field. Thanks to Leek’s insights, I am walking away from this post with a renewed and more open-minded view of social media’s many roles–not just in science and research, but in all professional spaces.
