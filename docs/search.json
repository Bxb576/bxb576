    "text": "A meaningful takeaway from Jeff Leek’s How to Be a Modern Scientist, in my opinion, was his breakdown of social media’s role in science. In today’s world, it’s essentially unfathomable that anyone would lack at least one form of social media presence. However, those of us who have either strayed away from it or try to maintain a healthy distance may struggle with this provision from Leek. As someone who tends to avoid most social media, the idea of cultivating an online persona for professional engagement in the future is a strange pill to swallow.\nIn his writing, Leek argues that forming a community online is the first step toward building a notable presence. The key strategies for doing so include posting relatable content for one’s intended audience and planting the seed for engaging forms of discourse. Now that many fellow researchers, scientific journals and news sources operate either entirely or heavily online, the space for networking has expanded into these virtual arenas as well.\nLeek’s explanation of social media’s importance in science and research spheres has inspired me to begin reframing my outlook, at least through a professional lens. While I still may not be fully open to embracing the world of social media, How to Be a Modern Scientist has opened my eyes to the need for flexibility when it comes to the digital side of society in science. As a budding research scientist, now is as crucial a time as ever to engage with future audiences and peers in my field. Thanks to Leek’s insights, I am walking away from this post with a renewed and more open-minded view of social media’s many roles–not just in science and research, but in all professional spaces."

I’m also a self-proclaimed foodie who enjoys discovering new things to try and hidden culinary gems. When I’m not studying or working, you’ll often find me home or outside with my dog, who is a puppy at heart even at 7 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Somewhere near Istanbul, Turkey.\n\n\n Paris, France.\n\n\n\n\n My dog, Oli.\n\n\n A very good wood-fired pizza place in my hometown of Washburn, WI."

    "text": "I began my undergraduate studies at Colorado State University, later completing my BS in Psychology at Capella University to accommodate a full-time work schedule. Knowing that I would need to add on substantially to my undergraduate degree to pursue the career I’d chosen, I built on that foundation by enrolling in the MS Clinical Research program at Case Western Reserve University. From here, I plan to pursue a PhD in Clinical Psychology."

Prior to graduate school, I gained nearly four years of full-time experience in the mental health field, where I developed invaluable real-world insights into patient care and behavioral health. This combination of academic study and practical experience empowers me to contribute meaningful perspectives to my research and envision innovative ways to bridge clinical needs with practical solutions. While this website is primarily meant to showcase my academic and professional journey, you’ll also find a section dedicated to some of my personal interests outside of school and work.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."
